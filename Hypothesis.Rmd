# Hypothesis

Postnatal environmental exposures, particularly those found in household products and dietary intake, along with specific serum metabolomics profiles, are significantly associated with the BMI Z-score of children aged 6-11 years. Higher concentrations of certain metabolites in serum, reflecting exposure to chemical classes or metals, will correlate with variations in BMI Z-score, controlling for age and other relevant covariates. High-dimensional metabolomics data can reveal comprehensive biochemical profiles that reflect environmental exposures and metabolic states. Not only that, but some metabolites associated with chemical exposures and dietary patterns can serve as biomarkers for the risk of developing obesity.

# Background

Research indicates that postnatal exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) such as phthalates, bisphenol A (BPA), and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) can significantly influence body weight and metabolic health ([Junge et al., 2018](https://clinicalepigeneticsjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13148-018-0478-z)). These chemicals, commonly found in household products and absorbed through dietary intake, are linked to detrimental effects on body weight and metabolic health in children. This hormonal interference can lead to an increased body mass index (BMI) in children, suggesting a potential pathway through which exposure to these chemicals contributes to the development of obesity.

A longitudinal study on Japanese children examined the impact of postnatal exposure (first two years of life) to p,p’*-*dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (p,p’*-*DDT) and p,p’*-*dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (p,p’*-*DDE) through breastfeeding ([Plouffe et al., 2020](https://ehjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12940-020-00603-z)). The findings revealed that higher levels of these chemicals in breast milk were associated with increased BMI at 42 months of age. DDT and DDE may interfere with hormonal pathways related to growth and development. These chemicals can mimic or disrupt hormones that regulate metabolism and fat accumulation. This study highlights the importance of understanding how persistent organic pollutants can affect early childhood growth and development.

The study by [Harley et al. (2013)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23416456/) investigates the association between prenatal and postnatal Bisphenol A (BPA) exposure and various body composition metrics in children aged 9 years from the CHAMACOS cohort. The study found that higher prenatal BPA exposure was linked to a decrease in BMI and body fat percentages in girls but not boys, suggesting sex-specific effects. Conversely, BPA levels measured at age 9 were positively associated with increased adiposity in both genders, highlighting the different impacts of exposure timing on childhood development.

The 2022 study [2022 study by Uldbjerg et al.](https://academic.oup.com/humupd/article/28/5/687/6573218) explored the effects of combined exposures to multiple EDCs, suggesting that mixtures of these chemicals can have additive or synergistic effects on BMI and obesity risk. Humans are typically exposed to a mixture of chemicals rather than individual EDCs, making it crucial to understand how these mixtures might interact. The research highlighted that the interaction between different EDCs can lead to additive (where the effects simply add up) or even synergistic (where the combined effect is greater than the sum of their separate effects) outcomes. These interactions can significantly amplify the risk factors associated with obesity and metabolic disorders in children. The dose-response relationship found that even low-level exposure to multiple EDCs could result in significant health impacts due to their combined effects.

These studies collectively illustrate the critical role of environmental EDCs in shaping metabolic health outcomes in children, highlighting the necessity for ongoing research and policy intervention to mitigate these risks.

# Data Description

This study will utilize data from the subcohort of 1301 mother-child pairs in the HELIX study, who are which aged 6-11 years for whom complete exposure and outcome data were available. Exposure data included detailed dietary records after pregnancy  and concentrations of various chemicals like BPA and PCBs in child blood samples. There are categorical and numerical variables, which will include both demographic details and biochemical measurements. This dataset allows for robust statistical analysis to identify potential associations between EDC exposure and changes in BMI Z-scores, considering confounding factors such as age, gender, and socioeconomic status. There are no missing data so there is not need to impute the information. Child BMI Z-scores were calculated based on WHO growth standards.

The Sum of KIDMED indices, without index9 histogram displays a multimodal distribution with peaks primarily at scores 0, 3, 5, 7, and 10. This suggests that the dataset has several subgroups within the population, each characterized by distinct dietary habits or patterns as measured by the KIDMED index, which assesses adherence to the Mediterranean diet. The distribution is discrete, reflecting integer scores that children have received based on their dietary intake. The modes indicate the most common dietary patterns, suggesting possible clusters of dietary behavior among the children sampled.

The second histogram depicts the distribution of clean and over-reported moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) in minutes per day. This histogram shows a right-skewed distribution, indicating that most children report lower levels of physical activity, with a smaller number of children reporting very high levels of activity, which might be over-reported. The peak near the lower end suggests that a significant portion of the sample engages in minimal to moderate amounts of MVPA, while the long tail to the right hints at a few cases with unusually high reported values, possibly due to over-reporting or measurement errors in data collection.

For sedentary behavior in minutes per day, there is a distribution that is slightly left-skewed in the histogram. Most children tend to have higher sedentary time, with a concentration of values towards the right side of the histogram. The distribution suggests that fewer children engage in lower levels of sedentary behavior, indicating a trend towards more inactivity among the sample. This pattern might raise concerns regarding lifestyle habits that contribute to prolonged periods of low physical activity.

The distribution of total hours of sleep per night (averaged over weekdays and weekends) exhibits a nearly normal distribution. This suggests that most children in the study have a consistent sleep duration with the bulk of the data clustering around the mean. The symmetry of the distribution indicates a healthy variance in sleep hours among the children, without significant extremes in either insufficient or excessive sleep, which is a positive indication of regular sleep patterns in this population.

PCB 118, 138, 153 (hs_pcb118_cadj_Log2, hs_pcb138_cadj_Log2, hs_pcb153_cadj_Log2): All three PCBs show similar distributions with right skewness, suggesting that exposure to these compounds is higher among a smaller segment of the population.

PCB 170 and PCB 180: Both histograms show a significant right skew, indicating lower concentrations of these chemicals in most samples, with fewer samples showing higher concentrations. This pattern suggests that while most individuals have low exposure, a few may have considerably higher levels.

Sum of PCBs: The histogram is approximately normally distributed, centered around a higher value compared to individual PCBs, indicating a collective higher average exposure when all measured PCBs are considered together.

DEP, DETP, DMTP, DMDTP, PBDE 153, and PBDE 47: These histograms mostly show multimodal distributions (more than one peak), suggesting different exposure sources or groups within the population that have distinct exposure levels. The multiple peaks could indicate varied exposure pathways or differences in how these chemicals are metabolized or retained in the body.

PFHxS, PFNA, and PFOA: These perfluorinated compounds display a roughly normal distribution skewed right, suggesting a common source of exposure among the population, but with some individuals experiencing higher exposures.

PFOS and PFUnDA: The histograms show a single, sharp peak with a rapid decline, indicating that most individuals have similar exposure levels, likely due to common environmental sources or regulatory controls limiting variability.

BPA: The histogram is sharply peaked near zero with a long tail to the right, indicating low exposure for most individuals but significant exposure for a few, possibly due to specific product use or occupational exposure.

MBZP (Monobenzyl Phthalate): This histogram shows a right-skewed distribution. Most values cluster at the lower end, indicating a common lower exposure level among subjects, with a long tail towards higher values suggesting occasional higher exposures.

MECPP (Mono-ethyl hexyl phthalate): The distribution is right-skewed, similar to MBZP, but with a smoother decline. This pattern also indicates that while most subjects have lower exposure levels, a few experience significantly higher exposures.

MEHHP (Mono-2-ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl phthalate): Exhibits a unimodal distribution with a peak around a middle value and symmetric tails. This could indicate a more standardized exposure level among the subjects with some variation.

MEHP (Mono-ethylhexyl phthalate):Another right-skewed distribution, indicating that most subjects have lower exposure levels but a few have much higher levels.

MEOHP (Mono-2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl phthalate): This histogram shows a distribution with a peak around the middle values and a tail extending towards higher values, suggesting a central tendency with some higher exposures.

ID: This histogram appears to show a uniform distribution of IDs over a range, with all IDs evenly spaced. This typical pattern is expected in a dataset where IDs are systematically assigned.

Maternal BMI (h_mbmi): The distribution of maternal BMI is roughly normal but slightly right-skewed, indicating that more individuals are on the higher side of the BMI scale. The peak of the histogram around the 25-30 range suggests a concentration of values in this area, which is typical for adult populations.

Weight Gain (hs_wgtgain): This histogram displays a bimodal distribution of weight gain, with significant peaks around 10 and another around 20. This could indicate two common patterns or recommendations in weight gain during pregnancy or another health-related period.

Gestational Age at Childbirth (e3_gac): The distribution is centered around the 40-week mark, which is typical for full-term pregnancies. There is a sharp peak at around 40 weeks, showing that most childbirths occur at this gestational age.

Maternal Age (h_age): This histogram shows a roughly normal distribution with a peak around the early 30s, suggesting that this is the most common age range for the mothers in the dataset.

Child's Age (hs_child_age): This histogram is multimodal, reflecting several peaks across different ages. This could be indicative of the data collection points or particular age groups being studied.

Child's Height (hs_c_height): The data is approximately normally distributed with a slight right skew. The majority of the measurements cluster around the mean, which suggests typical growth patterns.

Child's Weight (hs_c_weight): This histogram is right-skewed, indicating that while most children's weights are within a normal range, there is a long tail of children who weigh more, which might suggest variations in growth or cases of overweight.

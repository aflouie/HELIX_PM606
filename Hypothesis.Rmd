# Hypothesis

Prenatal exposure to lifestyle and chemicals are associated with variations in BMI z-score in children at age 6-11 years. This association will be controlled for dietary intake, physical activity, and socioeconomic status during and after pregnancy. The serum metabolomic data would be helpful to look at in terms of long-term metabolic status and systemic health related to chronic exposure effects, which could be linked to weight regulation and obesity.

# Background

Prenatal exposure to phthalates, which are widely recognized as endocrine-disrupting chemicals, has been increasingly associated with adverse health outcomes in children. Research suggests that phthalates may influence body weight regulation and metabolic processes through their hormonal actions, which could predispose children to obesity. A recent study within the Ma'anshan birth cohort highlighted the impact of prenatal exposure to phthalates such as mono-ethyl phthalate (MEP) and di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) on the trajectory of body mass index (BMI) in girls during the first six years of life. This study found that higher prenatal phthalate concentrations were associated with higher BMI trajectories, suggesting that exposure during pregnancy could play a significant role in shaping future obesity risk (Gao et al., 2022).

Research from the INMA cohort study (Montazeri et al., 2023) has highlighted that exposure to multiple EDCs during pregnancy is associated with varied growth trajectories in children, from birth through childhood. Specifically, persistent chemicals like hexachlorobenzene (HCB), DDE (a breakdown product of DDT), and PCBs have been found to contribute significantly to accelerated BMI gain starting from lower or higher birth sizes. This study suggests that prenatal exposure to these chemicals may predispose children to faster postnatal growth rates, which are linked to higher risks of obesity and other metabolic disorders later in life.

Moreover, a study by Yang et al. (2018) demonstrated that prenatal exposure to phthalates is linked to sex-specific differences in BMI trajectories from birth to adolescence, with third-trimester exposures being particularly critical. These findings underscore the potential for phthalates to disrupt metabolic health during critical windows of prenatal development, emphasizing the need for further exploration into how these exposures affect long-term health outcomes in children.

This study aims to provide further insights into the mechanisms by which prenatal environmental exposures contribute to obesity, potentially guiding public health strategies aimed at reducing these exposures during pregnancy.

# Data Description

Data for this study were derived from the six HELIX cohorts, encompassing over 31,472 mother-child pairs at different pregnancy stages from 1999 to 2010. The analysis focuses on 1,301 mother-children pairs from the HELIX subcohort, which aged 6-11 years for whom complete exposure and outcome data were available. Exposure data included detailed dietary records during pregnancy and concentrations of various chemicals like BPA and PCBs in maternal blood samples. Child BMI Z-scores were calculated based on WHO growth standards. Preliminary descriptive analysis showed a balanced distribution across genders and a wide range of socioeconomic statuses.
